Code Explanation

**Slide 1: Introduction**
- We have a Python class called `DeckOfCards` that represents a deck of playing cards.
- This class allows us to perform various actions on a deck of cards, including shuffling, sorting, and searching for specific cards.

**Slide 2: Class Initialization**
- In the `__init__` method, we define the `DeckOfCards` class.
- The class has two lists: `SUITS` representing the card suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and `VALUES` representing card values (2 through Ace).
- We create a list of card tuples by combining each suit with each value, which initializes the deck.
- We set an attribute `is_created` to `False` to track whether the deck has been created or not.

**Slide 3: Shuffling the Deck**
- The `shuffle_deck` method allows us to shuffle the deck of cards using the `shuffle` function from the Python `random` module.
- After shuffling, we set the `is_created` attribute to `True` to indicate that the deck has been created and shuffled.

**Slide 4: Sorting the Deck by Suit**
- We have a method called `sort_deck_by_suit`.
- This method sorts the deck of cards by suit. It uses the `sort` method with a custom sorting key.
- Cards are ordered first by their suits' position in the `SUITS` list and then by their values.

**Slide 5: Sorting the Deck by Value**
- The `sort_deck_by_value` method sorts the deck of cards by card values.
- It uses the `sort` method with a custom sorting key, this time based on card values and then suits.

**Slide 6: Searching for a Card**
- We can search for a specific card using the `search_card` method.
- You specify a suit and a value, and it returns the index of the card in the deck.
- If the card is not found, it returns -1.

**Slide 7: Example Usage**
- We create an instance of the `DeckOfCards` class, which represents our deck of cards.
- We shuffle the deck using the `shuffle_deck` method.
- Then, we sort the deck first by suit and then by value using the provided sorting methods.

**Slide 8: Searching for a Card (Continued)**
- We use the `search_card` method to find a specific card: 'Hearts, Ace.'
- If the card is found, we print its index in the deck. If not, we indicate that it was not found.

**Slide 9: Conclusion**
- In conclusion, this `DeckOfCards` class provides a convenient way to manipulate and work with a deck of playing cards, offering features like shuffling, sorting, and searching.
- This can be useful for various card games and applications that require working with decks of cards.

In summary

In this code:

1. We define a DeckOfCards class that represents a deck of cards with properties for checking if the deck is created.
2. We create methods for shuffling the deck and sorting it by suit and value.
3. The search_card method allows you to specify a suit and value to find a card's index. 
4. It uses the index method for this purpose.
5. Sorting is performed using the sort method, with custom key functions to specify the sorting order.
6. This implementation uses linear search for card searching, so it's not a constant-time lookup. 
   Achieving a constant-time lookup for searching specific cards in a shuffled deck is not practical. 
   However, you can improve search performance by maintaining a separate data structure (e.g., a dictionary) 
   that maps card descriptions to their positions in the deck. 
   This would allow constant-time lookup for card descriptions but would require additional memory 
   to store the mapping.
